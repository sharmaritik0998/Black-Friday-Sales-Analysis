# 🛍️ Black Friday Sales Analysis

This project analyzes consumer purchasing behavior during Black Friday using a dataset from a major retail store. The goal is to derive insights, build predictive models, and explore advanced business intelligence techniques to understand customer segmentation, product preferences, and sales patterns.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains ~550,000 purchase records with anonymized customer and product information. It includes demographic features (age, gender, occupation), product categories, and purchase amount.

**Source**: [Kaggle - Black Friday Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehdidag/black-friday)

### Key Columns:
- `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Product_ID`: Unique identifier for each product
- `Gender`, `Age`, `City_Category`: Demographic info
- `Occupation`, `Marital_Status`, `Stay_In_Current_City_Years`
- `Product_Category_1/2/3`: Product classification
- `Purchase`: Amount spent (target variable)

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Understand demographic influence on purchase behavior
- Visualize category-wise and city-wise sales trends
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding
- Build predictive models for estimating purchase amount
- Explore customer **segmentation using clustering**
- Suggest future improvements (e.g., recommendation system)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **ML Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KMeans
- **Data Visualization**: Bar plots, heatmaps, pairplots, sunburst charts

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Younger age groups (26–35) tend to spend the most.
- Males account for a higher percentage of purchases.
- City category "B" had the highest average purchase value.
- Product Category 1 is the most purchased segment.

## 🚀 Advanced Add-ons (Work in Progress)

- ✅ Customer segmentation with unsupervised learning
- ✅ Predictive model for purchase amount (regression)
- 🟡 Content-based recommendation engine
- 🟡 Dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash
- 🟡 Hypothesis testing on demographic behavior
